Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me (won't you love me?)
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear, only
I would beg and steal (beg and steal)
Just to feel (just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear, only
I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal)
Just to feel (yes, just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
