f I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice?
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice?
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me
Formulate infinity
Inside me
One more
This is called Lake of Fire
All these songs are off the second record
