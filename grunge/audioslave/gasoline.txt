House is haunted
I just wanna go for a ride
Out and on
Before I set this room alight
Left alone forever and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone
Someone take me far from here
Yeah, I'm burning that gasoline
Yeah, I'm burning that gasoline
New day yawning
Another day of solitaire
House is honest
Clearly more than I can bear
Drag me off
Before I set my world on fire
Out and gone
The sun will never set tonight
Yeah, I'm burning that gasoline
Yeah, I'm burning that gasoline
No what fors, only a can of red
It says danger on it
I have found another way
I'm burning that gasoline
Yeah, I'm burning that gasoline
Burning it all the way
Burning it all the way
