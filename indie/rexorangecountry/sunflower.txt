Sunflower
Rex Orange County

Whoa, I want to know 
Where I can go when you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment so I can say
I, I need you so?
'Cause right now, you know
That nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said: I'll love you till the day that I die
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And, to be honest, I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight

I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes

And so
She sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me
For as long as she's alive

And, well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly don't even know why
I, I honestly don't even know why

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the Sun's seen through my eyes
